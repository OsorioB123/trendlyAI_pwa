The AI engineer successfully initiated the project, laying a robust foundation for the TrendlyAI PWA. The development commenced by converting core authentication pages and an onboarding flow, including a global background selection system. Reusable card components (tool and track) were then implemented, followed by the Home Page, dynamically utilizing these cards and the chosen background.

Subsequently, the engineer focused on integrating three header variations across pages and developing a comprehensive Chat Page. After confirming these were largely complete, the work pivoted to converting additional critical user journey pages from provided HTML. This involved implementing My Profile, Subscription Management, Account Settings, and Help Center pages, ensuring exact visual fidelity, responsiveness, and specific functional requirements like background reflection and chat redirection.

Most recently, the All Tracks and All Tools pages were enhanced, incorporating search, filtering, and dynamic display of complete card components, including a detailed tool prompt modal. The current task involves building the Inside Track Card Page (Track Detail Page). Throughout, the engineer prioritizes visual accuracy, responsiveness, and uses React state, while temporarily sticking to JavaScript due to prior TypeScript configuration issues. Testing is diligently performed after each major implementation.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a React PWA named TrendlyAI by converting 14 pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JS screens from Aura Build. The application requires a complete user journey encompassing authentication, onboarding, home, and various content/management pages.

**Key Page Implementations:**
*   Login, Create Account, Forgot Password, Link Sent, Onboarding (first login only), Home, All Tracks, Inside Track Card, All Tools/Prompts, Inside Tool Card, Chat, My Profile, Manage Subscription, Account Settings, Paywall button.
*   Three Header variations (Primary, Secondary, Chat-specific).

**Reusable Components:**
*   Tool Cards (complete and compact), Track Cards (complete and compact) for dynamic display across pages.

**Background System:**
*   User-selectable backgrounds from 12 URLs during onboarding/profile, reflecting across all PWA screens.

**General Requirements:**
*   Exact visual fidelity (HTML match, hover effects, animations).
*   Responsiveness across devices.
*   Use React state for interactive elements.
*   TypeScript props/interfaces (temporarily reverted to JS).
*   Component structure ready for data integration.

**Specific Page Requirements (from recent user requests):**
*   **Account Settings**: Background selection here reflects globally.
*   **My Profile**: Utilizes compact track cards in Arsenal section.
*   **Help Center**: Falar com a Salina button redirects to the chat page.
*   **All Tracks/Tools**: Accessed via ver todas buttons from Home page. Uses complete card components. All Tools page needed tool card grid addition and mobile-specific compact layout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with converting the Inside Track Card Page (Track Detail Page) HTML into a React PWA component. This page is intended to appear when a user clicks on a specific track card.

The previous work involved completing the All Tracks and All Tools pages. These pages were significantly enhanced from provided HTML, incorporating detailed search and filter functionalities, and dynamically displaying  and  components in responsive grids. The All Tools page also features a prompt modal that activates upon clicking a tool card. This phase concluded successfully with the  confirming all functionalities and visual fidelity.

Before that, the AI engineer converted My Profile, Subscription Management, Account Settings, and Help Center pages, addressing specific user requirements such as background theme reflection from the  across the PWA, utilizing compact track cards in the , and ensuring the Falar com a Salina button on the  redirects to the chat page. A minor export issue in  was identified and fixed during testing.

The current state of the product is a robust React PWA with 13 fully functional pages. All implemented pages (authentication, onboarding, home, chat, profile, subscription, settings, help center, all tracks, all tools) maintain exact visual fidelity to the original HTML designs, are responsive, and utilize React state for interactive elements. The global background theme system is active and reflects across relevant pages. Headers with all their variations are integrated correctly where needed. The AI engineer has successfully retrieved and analyzed the HTML for the Inside Track Card Page and is ready to commence its implementation.
