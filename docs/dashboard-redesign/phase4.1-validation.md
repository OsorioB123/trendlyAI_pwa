# Phase 4.1 - Validation Summary

## Automated Checks
- npm run lint (Next.js ESLint wrapper) timed out twice after 120s and 300s; rerun locally once repo docs are pruned.
- npx tsc --noEmit fails because of pre-existing type errors in docs/analysis mock pages and chat/settings modules; dashboard additions compile after new guards.

## Manual Verification (performed)
- Reviewed the updated dashboard layout structure: Command Hub, KPI grid, Growth insights, Tasks, Highlights, Learning, Toolbelt.
- Confirmed the new Supabase service reuses the existing client and falls back gracefully when tables return no rows.
- Checked the shadcn-style primitives (card, tabs, progress, tooltip, scroll-area, table, dropdown) to ensure they follow project utility patterns.

## Recommended Follow-up Tests
- Start the dev server (npm run dev) and run npm run smoke:dev http://localhost:3000.
- Exercise Supabase flows: favorite tools or tracks and observe optimistic updates and fallback states.
- Run an accessibility sweep (axe or Lighthouse) focusing on color contrast, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion.
- Validate responsive layout on mobile/tablet breakpoints, especially Command Hub quick actions and chart overflow.
- Measure performance (Lighthouse or Web Vitals) while monitoring Recharts bundle impact.

## Outstanding Risks
- Global TypeScript errors block strict CI; align cleanup before enforcing build checks.
- Toolbelt modal depends on navigator.clipboard; confirm HTTPS context in production.
- Recharts adds roughly 40KB gzipped; track bundle analyzer results and split charts if necessary.
