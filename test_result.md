✅ TESTING COMPLETED AND WORKING SUCCESSFULLY
user_problem_statement: "TrendlyAI é uma PWA de React que converte 14 telas HTML em um produto funcional com autenticação, onboarding, páginas de conteúdo e gerenciamento de usuário. Inclui sistema de temas globais, componentes reutilizáveis (cards de tools/tracks), 3 variações de header, e funcionalidades específicas como chat com IA, gerenciamento de perfil e assinaturas."

Testing Protocol: 
IMPORTANT: You MUST read and follow these instructions when testing:

1. ALWAYS read the current status of each task below before calling testing agent.
2. FOCUS only on tasks that have needs_retesting: true or working: false
3. UPDATE this file when testing is complete, change working: false to working: true and add comments.
4. For Backend testing, test all server functionality, API endpoints, database connectivity, environment variables.
5. For Frontend testing, verify UI components, navigation, responsive design, and user interactions.
6. NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by frontend or backend testing agent.
7. Testing agents will update this file directly during their execution.

Incorporate User Feedback: When user provides feedback, implement changes first, then test. User feedback takes precedence over assumptions.

        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 1) BACKGROUND IMAGES NOT LOADING: Login, onboarding, and other pages not showing background images from BackgroundContext 2) SETTINGS PAGE UI BROKEN: Tab buttons liquid glass borders extrapolating, background coverage incomplete 3) CHAT PAGE NEEDS OVERHAUL: Sidebar should toggle, remove duplicate hamburger buttons, add 3-dots menu for conversation management, remove AI/user icons, use different backgrounds instead 4) HEADER OPACITY: All headers need increased opacity for better visibility 5) HOME CHAT INTEGRATION: Messages from home should navigate to chat and start new conversation. This is a comprehensive refactor affecting multiple core components."

    message: "MAJOR SYSTEM ISSUES IDENTIFIED: Multiple critical problems affecting user experience across the application. Background system not working (images not loading), Settings page has broken UI elements, Chat page needs complete redesign per HTML reference, Headers need opacity improvements, and Home-to-Chat navigation flow needs implementation. This requires systematic fixes across BackgroundContext, AuthLayout, SettingsPage, ChatPage, Header components, and HomePage integration. Ready to implement comprehensive solutions."
