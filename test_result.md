Testing Protocol: 
IMPORTANT: You MUST read and follow these instructions when testing:

1. ALWAYS read the current status of each task below before calling testing agent.
2. FOCUS only on tasks that have needs_retesting: true or working: false
3. UPDATE this file when testing is complete, change working: false to working: true and add comments.
4. For Backend testing, test all server functionality, API endpoints, database connectivity, environment variables.
5. For Frontend testing, verify UI components, navigation, responsive design, and user interactions.
6. NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by frontend or backend testing agent.
7. Testing agents will update this file directly during their execution.

Incorporate User Feedback: When user provides feedback, implement changes first, then test. User feedback takes precedence over assumptions.
